    <h1>Shrimp Fried Rice</h1>
    <p>Shrimp fried rice is always my go-to dish. It is simple, but delicious. I could make it in 15 minutes with some leftover rice from the day before. And leftover rice is actually very good for making stir-fried rice, not so wet and not so dry. It is perfect for kids school lunch, or outdoor picnic, or take-along meal for zoo/park trip. </p>
